In recent years, the success achieved
through neural machine translation has
made it mainstream in machine translation
systems. In this work, encoder-decoder
with attention system based on ”Neural
Machine Translation by Jointly Learning
to Align and Translate” by Bahdanau et al.
(2014) has been used to accomplish the
Machine Translation between English and
Spanish Language which has not seen
much research work done as compared
to other languages such as German and
French. We aim to demonstrate the results similar to the breakthrough paper on
which our work is based on. We achieved
a BLEU score of 25.37, which was close
enough to what Bahdanau et al. (2014)
achieved in their work.
